# CMPRSSD-Wisdom [![Run on replit](https://replit.com/badge/github/Sirri69/CMPRSSD-Wisdom "Run on replit")](https://CMPRSSD-Wisdom.pranavpatel4.repl.co "Run on replit")

This site contains the summaries of blog posts of some of the most reputable people in tech and bussiness field.

Summaries are generated by a model (facebook/bart-large-cnn) provided by [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn). Some of the generated summaries contain linguistic errors, but I didn't care to correct them as this was more of a web dev project than a AI/NLP project.

The site is built using React, React Router and Flask. Generated summaries live on MongoDB.

### Possible future features

- Addition of a caching layer if the project size grows
- Try to add book summaries to the site
- Better UI colors maybe ?
