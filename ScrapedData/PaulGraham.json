    "content": "May 2021There's one kind of opinion I'd be very afraid to express publicly. If someone I knew to be both a domain expert and a reasonable person proposed an idea that sounded preposterous, I'd be very reluctant to say \"That will never work.\"Anyone who has studied the history of ideas, and especially the history of science, knows that's how big things start. Someone proposes an idea that sounds crazy, most people dismiss it, then it gradually takes over the world.Most implausible-sounding ideas are in fact bad and could be safely dismissed. But not when they're proposed by reasonable domain experts. If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then they know how implausible it sounds. And yet they're proposing it anyway. That suggests they know something you don't. And if they have deep domain expertise, that's probably the source of it. [1]Such ideas are not merely unsafe to dismiss, but disproportionately likely to be interesting. When the average person proposes an implausible-sounding idea, its implausibility is evidence of their incompetence. But when a reasonable domain expert does it, the situation is reversed. There's something like an efficient market here: on average the ideas that seem craziest will, if correct, have the biggest effect. So if you can eliminate the theory that the person proposing an implausible-sounding idea is incompetent, its implausibility switches from evidence that it's boring to evidence that it's exciting. [2]Such ideas are not guaranteed to work. But they don't have to be. They just have to be sufficiently good bets — to have sufficiently high expected value. And I think on average they do. I think if you bet on the entire set of implausible-sounding ideas proposed by reasonable domain experts, you'd end up net ahead.The reason is that everyone is too conservative. The word \"paradigm\" is overused, but this is a case where it's warranted. Everyone is too much in the grip of the current paradigm. Even the people who have the new ideas undervalue them initially. Which means that before they reach the stage of proposing them publicly, they've already subjected them to an excessively strict filter. [3]The wise response to such an idea is not to make statements, but to ask questions, because there's a real mystery here. Why has this smart and reasonable person proposed an idea that seems so wrong? Are they mistaken, or are you? One of you has to be. If you're the one who's mistaken, that would be good to know, because it means there's a hole in your model of the world. But even if they're mistaken, it should be interesting to learn why. A trap that an expert falls into is one you have to worry about too.This all seems pretty obvious. And yet there are clearly a lot of people who don't share my fear of dismissing new ideas. Why do they do it? Why risk looking like a jerk now and a fool later, instead of just reserving judgement?One reason they do it is envy. If you propose a radical new idea and it succeeds, your reputation (and perhaps also your wealth) will increase proportionally. Some people would be envious if that happened, and this potential envy propagates back into a conviction that you must be wrong.Another reason people dismiss new ideas is that it's an easy way to seem sophisticated. When a new idea first emerges, it usually seems pretty feeble. It's a mere hatchling. Received wisdom is a full-grown eagle by comparison. So it's easy to launch a devastating attack on a new idea, and anyone who does will seem clever to those who don't understand this asymmetry.This phenomenon is exacerbated by the difference between how those working on new ideas and those attacking them are rewarded. The rewards for working on new ideas are weighted by the value of the outcome. So it's worth working on something that only has a 10% chance of succeeding if it would make things more than 10x better. Whereas the rewards for attacking new ideas are roughly constant; such attacks seem roughly equally clever regardless of the target.People will also attack new ideas when they have a vested interest in the old ones. It's not surprising, for example, that some of Darwin's harshest critics were churchmen. People build whole careers on some ideas. When someone claims they're false or obsolete, they feel threatened.The lowest form of dismissal is mere factionalism: to automatically dismiss any idea associated with the opposing faction. The lowest form of all is to dismiss an idea because of who proposed it.But the main thing that leads reasonable people to dismiss new ideas is the same thing that holds people back from proposing them: the sheer pervasiveness of the current paradigm. It doesn't just affect the way we think; it is the Lego blocks we build thoughts out of. Popping out of the current paradigm is something only a few people can do. And even they usually have to suppress their intuitions at first, like a pilot flying through cloud who has to trust his instruments over his sense of balance. [4]Paradigms don't just define our present thinking. They also vacuum up the trail of crumbs that led to them, making our standards for new ideas impossibly high. The current paradigm seems so perfect to us, its offspring, that we imagine it must have been accepted completely as soon as it was discovered. Whatever the church thought of the heliocentric model, astronomers must have been convinced as soon as Copernicus proposed it. Far, in fact, from it. Copernicus published the heliocentric model in 1532, but it wasn't till the mid seventeenth century that the balance of scientific opinion shifted in its favor. [5]Few understand how feeble new ideas look when they first appear. So if you want to have new ideas yourself, one of the most valuable things you can do is to learn what they look like when they're born. Read about how new ideas happened, and try to get yourself into the heads of people at the time. How did things look to them, when the new idea was only half-finished, and even the person who had it was only half-convinced it was right?But you don't have to stop at history. You can observe big new ideas being born all around you right now. Just look for a reasonable domain expert proposing something that sounds wrong.If you're nice, as well as wise, you won't merely resist attacking such people, but encourage them. Having new ideas is a lonely business. Only those who've tried it know how lonely. These people need your help. And if you help them, you'll probably learn something in the process.Notes[1] This domain expertise could be in another field. Indeed, such crossovers tend to be particularly promising.[2] I'm not claiming this principle extends much beyond math, engineering, and the hard sciences. In politics, for example, crazy-sounding ideas generally are as bad as they sound. Though arguably this is not an exception, because the people who propose them are not in fact domain experts; politicians are domain experts in political tactics, like how to get elected and how to get legislation passed, but not in the world that policy acts upon. Perhaps no one could be.[3] This sense of \"paradigm\" was defined by Thomas Kuhn in his Structure of Scientific Revolutions, but I also recommend his Copernican Revolution, where you can see him at work developing the idea.[4] This is one reason people with a touch of Asperger's may have an advantage in discovering new ideas. They're always flying on instruments.[5] Hall, Rupert. From Galileo to Newton. Collins, 1963.

    "title": "Life is Short",
    "link": "http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html",
    "content": "January 2016Life is short, as everyone knows. When I was a kid I used to wonder about this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining about its finiteness?  Would we be just as likely to feel life was short if we lived 10 times as long?Since there didn't seem any way to answer this question, I stopped wondering about it.  Then I had kids.  That gave me a way to answer the question, and the answer is that life actually is short.Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old.  If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only get to watch your child experience it 8 times.  And while it's impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something.  If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.Ok, so life actually is short.  Does it make any difference to know that?It has for me.  It means arguments of the form \"Life is too short for x\" have great force.  It's not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something.  It's not just a synonym for annoying.  If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is \"bullshit.\" I realize that answer is somewhat tautological.  It's almost the definition of bullshit that it's the stuff that life is too short for.  And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character.  There's something fake about it. It's the junk food of experience. [1]If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit, you probably already know the answer.  Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's either forced on you, or it tricks you.  To some extent you have to put up with the bullshit forced on you by circumstances.  You need to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands.  Indeed, the law of supply and demand insures that: the more rewarding some kind of work is, the cheaper people will do it.  It may be that less bullshit is forced on you than you think, though.  There has always been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and go live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional sense, but life feels more authentic.  This could become more common.You can do it on a smaller scale without moving.  The amount of time you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers.  Most large organizations (and many small ones) are steeped in it.  But if you consciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factors like money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will waste less of your time.If you're a freelancer or a small company, you can do this at the level of individual customers.  If you fire or avoid toxic customers, you can decrease the amount of bullshit in your life by more than you decrease your income.But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the bullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's fault but your own.  And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder to eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you.  Things that lure you into wasting your time have to be really good at tricking you.  An example that will be familiar to a lot of people is arguing online.  When someone contradicts you, they're in a sense attacking you. Sometimes pretty overtly.  Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself.  But like a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we now live in.  Counterintuitive as it feels, it's better most of the time not to defend yourself.  Otherwise these people are literally taking your life. [2]Arguing online is only incidentally addictive. There are more dangerous things than that. As I've written before, one byproduct of technical progress is that things we like tend to become more addictive.  Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious effort to avoid addictions  to stand outside ourselves and ask \"is this how I want to be spending my time?\"As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things that matter.  But different things matter to different people, and most have to learn what matters to them.  A few are lucky and realize early on that they love math or taking care of animals or writing, and then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it.  But most people start out with a life that's a mix of things that matter and things that don't, and only gradually learn to distinguish between them.For the young especially, much of this confusion is induced by the artificial situations they find themselves in. In middle school and high school, what the other kids think of you seems the most important thing in the world.  But when you ask adults what they got wrong at that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kids thought of them.One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future.  Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter.  That's how it tricks you.  The area under the curve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.The things that matter aren't necessarily the ones people would call \"important.\"  Having coffee with a friend matters.  You won't feel later like that was a waste of time.One great thing about having small children is that they make you spend time on things that matter: them. They grab your sleeve as you're staring at your phone and say \"will you play with me?\" And odds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option.If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by surprise. And that is just what tends to happen.  You take things for granted, and then they're gone.  You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed.  The saddest windows close when other people die. Their lives are short too.  After my mother died, I wished I'd spent more time with her.  I lived as if she'd always be there. And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion.  But an illusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I did.The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to be consciously aware of it.  Back when life was more precarious, people used to be aware of death to a degree that would now seem a bit morbid.  I'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the right answer to be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at everyone's shoulder.  Perhaps a better solution is to look at the problem from the other end. Cultivate a habit of impatience about the things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother.  You don't need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait. Just don't wait.I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has.  Both make sense here.How you live affects how long you live.  Most people could do better. Me among them.But you can probably get even more effect by paying closer attention to the time you have.  It's easy to let the days rush by.  The \"flow\" that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousin that prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurry of errands and alarms.  One of the most striking things I've read was not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter's Burning the Days.It is possible to slow time somewhat. I've gotten better at it. Kids help.  When you have small children, there are a lot of moments so perfect that you can't help noticing.It does help too to feel that you've squeezed everything out of some experience.  The reason I'm sad about my mother is not just that I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have done that we didn't.  My oldest son will be 7 soon.  And while I miss the 3 year old version of him, I at least don't have any regrets over what might have been.  We had the best time a daddy and a 3 year old ever had.Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have.  That's what you do when life is short.Notes[1] At first I didn't like it that the word that came to mind was one that had other meanings.  But then I realized the other meanings are fairly closely related.  Bullshit in the sense of things you waste your time on is a lot like intellectual bullshit.[2] I chose this example deliberately as a note to self.  I get attacked a lot online.  People tell the craziest lies about me. And I have so far done a pretty mediocre job of suppressing the natural human inclination to say \"Hey, that's not true!\"Thanks to Jessica Livingston and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this.Korean TranslationJapanese TranslationChinese Translation"

    "title": "How to Lose Time and Money ",
    "link": "http://www.paulgraham.com/selfindulgence.html",
    "content": "July 2010When we sold our startup in 1998 I suddenly got a lot of money.  I\r now had to think about something I hadn't had to think about before:\r how not to lose it.   I knew it was possible to go from rich to\r poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich.  But while\r I'd spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from\r poor to rich, \r I knew practically nothing about the paths from rich\r to poor.  Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they\r were.So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost.  If you'd\r asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I'd have said by\r spending all their money.  That's how it happens in books and movies,\r because that's the colorful way to do it.  But in fact the way most\r fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through\r bad investments.It's hard to spend a fortune without noticing.  Someone with ordinary\r tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of\r thousands of dollars without thinking \"wow, I'm spending a lot of\r money.\"  Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a\r million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an\r eye.In most people's minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms\r that making investments doesn't.  Luxuries seem self-indulgent.\r And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery,\r you've already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads\r to trouble.  Investing bypasses those alarms.  You're not spending\r the money; you're just moving it from one asset to another.  Which\r is why people trying to sell you expensive things say \"it's an\r investment.\"The solution is to develop new alarms.  This can be a tricky business,\r because while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are so\r basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you\r from making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes\r fairly counterintuitive.A few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with\r time is much the same as with money.  The most dangerous way to\r lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake\r work.  When you spend time having fun, you know you're being\r self-indulgent.  Alarms start to go off fairly quickly.  If I woke\r up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I'd\r feel like something was terribly wrong.  Just thinking about it\r makes me wince.  I'd start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on\r a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.And yet I've definitely had days when I might as well have sat in\r front of a TV all day — days at the end of which, if I asked myself\r what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically,\r nothing.  I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad\r as I'd feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV.  If\r I spent a whole day watching TV I'd feel like I was descending into\r perdition.  But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get\r nothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially,\r like real work.  Dealing with email, for example.  You do it sitting\r at a desk.  It's not fun.  So it must be work.With time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to\r protect you.  It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers,\r and perhaps all pre-industrial societies.  So nature and nurture\r combine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world has gotten\r more complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors\r that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more\r virtuous types.  And the worst thing is, they're not even fun. Thanks to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Jessica\r Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this."

    "title": "Startups in 13 Sentences",
    "link": "http://www.paulgraham.com/13sentences.html",
    "content": "  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.      Watch how this essay was written.     February 2009One of the things I always tell startups is a principle I learned from Paul Buchheit: it's better to make a few people really happy than to make a lot of people semi-happy.  I was saying recently to a reporter that if I could only tell startups 10 things, this would be one of them.  Then I thought: what would the other 9 be?When I made the list there turned out to be 13:  1. Pick good cofounders.Cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate.  You can change anything about a house except where it is.  In a startup you can change your idea easily, but changing your cofounders is hard.  [1] And the success of a startup is almost always a function of its founders.2. Launch fast.The reason to launch fast is not so much that it's critical to get your product to market early, but that you haven't really started working on it till you've launched.  Launching teaches you what you should have been building.  Till you know that you're wasting your time.  So the main value of whatever you launch with is as a pretext for engaging users.3. Let your idea evolve.This is the second half of launching fast. Launch fast and iterate. It's a big mistake to treat a startup as if it were merely a matter of implementing some brilliant initial idea. As in an essay, most of the ideas appear in the implementing.4. Understand your users.You can envision the wealth created by a startup as a rectangle, where one side is the number of users and the other is how much you improve their lives. [2] The second dimension is the one you have most control over.  And indeed, the growth in the first will be driven by how well you do in the second.  As in science, the hard part is not answering questions but asking them: the hard part is seeing something new that users lack. The better you understand them the better the odds of doing that. That's why so many successful startups make something the founders needed.5. Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent.Ideally you want to make large numbers of users love you, but you can't expect to hit that right away.  Initially you have to choose between satisfying all the needs of a subset of potential users, or satisfying a subset of the needs of all potential users.  Take the first. It's easier to expand userwise than satisfactionwise. And perhaps more importantly, it's harder to lie to yourself.  If you think you're 85% of the way to a great product, how do you know it's not 70%?  Or 10%?  Whereas it's easy to know how many users you have.6. Offer surprisingly good customer service.Customers are used to being maltreated.  Most of the companies they deal with are quasi-monopolies that get away with atrocious customer service. Your own ideas about what's possible have been unconsciously lowered by such experiences.  Try making your customer service not merely good, but  surprisingly good.  Go out of your way to make people happy.  They'll be overwhelmed; you'll see.  In the earliest stages of a startup, it pays to offer customer service on a level that wouldn't scale, because it's a way of learning about your users.7. You make what you measure.I learned this one from Joe Kraus.  [3] Merely measuring something has an uncanny tendency to improve it.  If you want to make your user numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and every day plot the number of users.  You'll be delighted when it goes up and disappointed when it goes down.  Pretty soon you'll start noticing what makes the number go up, and you'll start to do more of that.  Corollary: be careful what you measure.8. Spend little.I can't emphasize enough how important it is for a startup to be cheap. Most startups fail before they make something people want, and the most common form of failure is running out of money.  So being cheap is (almost) interchangeable with iterating rapidly. [4] But it's more than that.  A culture of cheapness keeps companies young in something like the way exercise keeps people young.9. Get ramen profitable.\"Ramen profitable\" means a startup makes just enough to pay the founders' living expenses.  It's not rapid prototyping for business models (though it can be), but more a way of hacking the investment process.  Once you cross over into ramen profitable, it completely changes your relationship with investors.  It's also great for morale.10. Avoid distractions.Nothing kills startups like distractions.  The worst type are those that pay money: day jobs, consulting, profitable side-projects. The startup may have more long-term potential, but you'll always interrupt working on it to answer calls from people paying you now. Paradoxically, fundraising is this type of distraction, so try to minimize that too.11. Don't get demoralized.Though the immediate cause of death in a startup tends to be running out of money, the underlying cause is usually lack of focus.  Either the company is run by stupid people (which can't be fixed with advice) or the people are smart but got demoralized.  Starting a startup is a huge moral weight.  Understand this and make a conscious effort not to be ground down by it, just as you'd be careful to bend at the knees when picking up a heavy box.12. Don't give up.Even if you get demoralized, don't give up.  You can get surprisingly far by just not giving up.  This isn't true in all fields.  There are a lot of people who couldn't become good mathematicians no matter how long they persisted.  But startups aren't like that. Sheer effort is usually enough, so long as you keep morphing your idea.13. Deals fall through.One of the most useful skills we learned from Viaweb was not getting our hopes up.  We probably had 20 deals of various types fall through.  After the first 10 or so we learned to treat deals as background processes that we should ignore till they terminated. It's very dangerous to morale to start to depend on deals closing, not just because they so often don't, but because it makes them less likely to.  Having gotten it down to 13 sentences, I asked myself which I'd choose if I could only keep one.Understand your users.  That's the key.  The essential task in a startup is to create wealth; the dimension of wealth you have most control over is how much you improve users' lives; and the hardest part of that is knowing what to make for them.  Once you know what to make, it's mere effort to make it, and most decent hackers are capable of that.Understanding your users is part of half the principles in this list.  That's the reason to launch early, to understand your users. Evolving your idea is the embodiment of understanding your users. Understanding your users well will tend to push you toward making something that makes a few people deeply happy.  The most important reason for having surprisingly good customer service is that it helps you understand your users.  And understanding your users will even ensure your morale, because when everything else is collapsing around you, having just ten users who love you will keep you going.Notes[1] Strictly speaking it's impossible without a time machine.[2] In practice it's more like a ragged comb.[3] Joe thinks one of the founders of Hewlett Packard said it first, but he doesn't remember which.[4] They'd be interchangeable if markets stood still.  Since they don't, working twice as fast is better than having twice as much time.Turkish TranslationSpanish TranslationBulgarian TranslationJapanese TranslationPersian Translation"

    "title": "How to Be an Expert in a Changing World",
    "link": "http://www.paulgraham.com/ecw.html",
    "content": "December 2014If the world were static, we could have monotonically increasing confidence in our beliefs.  The more (and more varied) experience a belief survived, the less likely it would be false.  Most people implicitly believe something like this about their opinions.  And they're justified in doing so with opinions about things that don't change much, like human nature.  But you can't trust your opinions in the same way about things that change, which could include practically everything else.When experts are wrong, it's often because they're experts on an earlier version of the world.Is it possible to avoid that?  Can you protect yourself against obsolete beliefs?  To some extent, yes. I spent almost a decade investing in early stage startups, and curiously enough protecting yourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do to succeed as a startup investor.  Most really good startup ideas look like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically because some change in the world just switched them from bad to good.  I spent a lot of time learning to recognize such ideas, and the techniques I used may be applicable to ideas in general.The first step is to have an explicit belief in change.  People who fall victim to a monotonically increasing confidence in their opinions are implicitly concluding the world is static.  If you consciously remind yourself it isn't, you start to look for change.Where should one look for it?  Beyond the moderately useful generalization that human nature doesn't change much, the unfortunate fact is that change is hard to predict.  This is largely a tautology but worth remembering all the same: change that matters usually comes from an unforeseen quarter.So I don't even try to predict it.  When I get asked in interviews to predict the future, I always have to struggle to come up with something plausible-sounding on the fly, like a student who hasn't prepared for an exam. [1] But it's not out of laziness that I haven't prepared.  It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so rarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigidity they impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively open-minded.  Instead of trying to point yourself in the right direction, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, and try instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change.It's ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain you a bit, because they also motivate you.  It's exciting to chase things and exciting to try to guess answers.  But you have to be disciplined about not letting your hypotheses harden into anything more. [2]I believe this passive m.o. works not just for evaluating new ideas but also for having them.  The way to come up with new ideas is not to try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply not discount weird hunches you have in the process.The winds of change originate in the unconscious minds of domain experts.  If you're sufficiently expert in a field, any weird idea or apparently irrelevant question that occurs to you is ipso facto worth exploring.  [3]  Within Y Combinator, when an idea is described as crazy, it's a compliment—in fact, on average probably a higher compliment than when an idea is described as good.Startup investors have extraordinary incentives for correcting obsolete beliefs.  If they can realize before other investors that some apparently unpromising startup isn't, they can make a huge amount of money.  But the incentives are more than just financial. Investors' opinions are explicitly tested: startups come to them and they have to say yes or no, and then, fairly quickly, they learn whether they guessed right.  The investors who say no to a Google (and there were several) will remember it for the rest of their lives.Anyone who must in some sense bet on ideas rather than merely commenting on them has similar incentives.  Which means anyone who wants such incentives can have them, by turning their comments into bets: if you write about a topic in some fairly durable and public form, you'll find you worry much more about getting things right than most people would in a casual conversation. [4]Another trick I've found to protect myself against obsolete beliefs is to focus initially on people rather than ideas. Though the nature of future discoveries is hard to predict, I've found I can predict quite well what sort of people will make them.  Good new ideas come from earnest, energetic, independent-minded people.Betting on people over ideas saved me countless times as an investor. We thought Airbnb was a bad idea, for example. But we could tell the founders were earnest, energetic, and independent-minded. (Indeed, almost pathologically so.)  So we suspended disbelief and funded them.This too seems a technique that should be generally applicable. Surround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from.  If you want to notice quickly when your beliefs become obsolete, you can't do better than to be friends with the people whose discoveries will make them so.It's hard enough already not to become the prisoner of your own expertise, but it will only get harder, because change is accelerating. That's not a recent trend; change has been accelerating since the paleolithic era.  Ideas beget ideas.  I don't expect that to change. But I could be wrong. Notes[1] My usual trick is to talk about aspects of the present that most people haven't noticed yet.[2] Especially if they become well enough known that people start to identify them with you.  You have to be extra skeptical about things you want to believe, and once a hypothesis starts to be identified with you, it will almost certainly start to be in that category.[3] In practice \"sufficiently expert\" doesn't require one to be recognized as an expert—which is a trailing indicator in any case.  In many fields a year of focused work plus caring a lot would be enough.[4] Though they are public and persist indefinitely, comments on e.g. forums and places like Twitter seem empirically to work like casual conversation.  The threshold may be whether what you write has a title. Thanks to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.Spanish TranslationArabic Translation"

    "content": "February 2020What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That's what a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we can aim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.To start with, that means it should be correct. But it's not enough merely to be correct. It's easy to make a statement correct by making it vague. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for example. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go wrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are many factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too simplistic a view of it, and so on.Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing. Useful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made without becoming false.For example, it's more useful to say that Pike's Peak is near the middle of Colorado than merely somewhere in Colorado. But if I say it's in the exact middle of Colorado, I've now gone too far, because it's a bit east of the middle.Precision and correctness are like opposing forces. It's easy to satisfy one if you ignore the other. The converse of vaporous academic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues. Useful writing is bold, but true.It's also two other things: it tells people something important, and that at least some of them didn't already know.Telling people something they didn't know doesn't always mean surprising them. Sometimes it means telling them something they knew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact those may be the more valuable insights, because they tend to be more fundamental.Let's put them all together. Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn't already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.Notice these are all a matter of degree. For example, you can't expect an idea to be novel to everyone. Any insight that you have will probably have already been had by at least one of the world's 7 billion people. But it's sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot of readers.Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength. In effect the four components are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score for usefulness. Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, but nonetheless true._____ How can you ensure that the things you say are true and novel and important? Believe it or not, there is a trick for doing this. I learned it from my friend Robert Morris, who has a horror of saying anything dumb. His trick is not to say anything unless he's sure it's worth hearing. This makes it hard to get opinions out of him, but when you do, they're usually right.Translated into essay writing, what this means is that if you write a bad sentence, you don't publish it. You delete it and try again. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes a whole essay.You can't ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can ensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the ones that aren't.In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered bad. When some hypothesis you're exploring gets inconclusive results, you're supposed to tell people about that too. But with essay writing, publication bias is the way to go.My strategy is loose, then tight. I write the first draft of an essay fast, trying out all kinds of ideas. Then I spend days rewriting it very carefully.I've never tried to count how many times I proofread essays, but I'm sure there are sentences I've read 100 times before publishing them. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that stick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they're clumsily written, and sometimes because I'm not sure they're true. The annoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading or so I'm saying \"Ugh, that part\" each time I hit it. They become like briars that catch your sleeve as you walk past. Usually I won't publish an essay till they're all gone  till I can read through the whole thing without the feeling of anything catching.I'll sometimes let through a sentence that seems clumsy, if I can't think of a way to rephrase it, but I will never knowingly let through one that doesn't seem correct. You never have to. If a sentence doesn't seem right, all you have to do is ask why it doesn't, and you've usually got the replacement right there in your head.This is where essayists have an advantage over journalists. You don't have a deadline. You can work for as long on an essay as you need to get it right. You don't have to publish the essay at all, if you can't get it right. Mistakes seem to lose courage in the face of an enemy with unlimited resources. Or that's what it feels like. What's really going on is that you have different expectations for yourself. You're like a parent saying to a child \"we can sit here all night till you eat your vegetables.\" Except you're the child too.I'm not saying no mistake gets through. For example, I added condition (c) in \"A Way to Detect Bias\"  after readers pointed out that I'd omitted it. But in practice you can catch nearly all of them.There's a trick for getting importance too. It's like the trick I suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader. The reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about topics that seem important to you, they'll probably seem important to a significant number of readers as well.Importance has two factors. It's the number of people something matters to, times how much it matters to them. Which means of course that it's not a rectangle, but a sort of ragged comb, like a Riemann sum.The way to get novelty is to write about topics you've thought about a lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this department too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who've thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a significant number of readers. And here, as with correctness and importance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that you will. If you don't learn anything from writing an essay, don't publish it.You need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging the novelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance of it. Confidence and humility are often seen as opposites, but in this case, as in many others, confidence helps you to be humble. If you know you're an expert on some topic, you can freely admit when you learn something you didn't know, because you can be confident that most other people wouldn't know it either.The fourth component of useful writing, strength, comes from two things: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification. These two counterbalance each other, like the accelerator and clutch in a car with a manual transmission. As you try to refine the expression of an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly. Something you're sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification at all, as I did the four components of useful writing. Whereas points that seem dubious have to be held at arm's length with perhapses.As you refine an idea, you're pushing in the direction of less qualification. But you can rarely get it down to zero. Sometimes you don't even want to, if it's a side point and a fully refined version would be too long.Some say that qualifications weaken writing. For example, that you should never begin a sentence in an essay with \"I think,\" because if you're saying it, then of course you think it. And it's true that \"I think x\" is a weaker statement than simply \"x.\" Which is exactly why you need \"I think.\" You need it to express your degree of certainty.But qualifications are not scalars. They're not just experimental error. There must be 50 things they can express: how broadly something applies, how you know it, how happy you are it's so, even how it could be falsified. I'm not going to try to explore the structure of qualification here. It's probably more complex than the whole topic of writing usefully. Instead I'll just give you a practical tip: Don't underestimate qualification. It's an important skill in its own right, not just a sort of tax you have to pay in order to avoid saying things that are false. So learn and use its full range. It may not be fully half of having good ideas, but it's part of having them.There's one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things as simply as possible. But I don't think this is a component of usefulness. It's more a matter of consideration for the reader. And it's a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more obvious when expressed in simple language. But I'll admit that the main reason I write simply is not for the reader's sake or because it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more or fancier words than I need to. It seems inelegant, like a program that's too long.I realize florid writing works for some people. But unless you're sure you're one of them, the best advice is to write as simply as you can._____ I believe the formula I've given you, importance + novelty + correctness + strength, is the recipe for a good essay. But I should warn you that it's also a recipe for making people mad.The root of the problem is novelty. When you tell people something they didn't know, they don't always thank you for it. Sometimes the reason people don't know something is because they don't want to know it. Usually because it contradicts some cherished belief. And indeed, if you're looking for novel ideas, popular but mistaken beliefs are a good place to find them. Every popular mistaken belief creates a dead zone of ideas around  it that are relatively unexplored because they contradict it.The strength component just makes things worse. If there's anything that annoys people more than having their cherished assumptions contradicted, it's having them flatly contradicted.Plus if you've used the Morris technique, your writing will seem quite confident. Perhaps offensively confident, to people who disagree with you. The reason you'll seem confident is that you are confident: you've cheated, by only publishing the things you're sure of.  It will seem to people who try to disagree with you that you never admit you're wrong. In fact you constantly admit you're wrong. You just do it before publishing instead of after.And if your writing is as simple as possible, that just makes things worse. Brevity is the diction of command. If you watch someone delivering unwelcome news from a position of inferiority, you'll notice they tend to use lots of words, to soften the blow. Whereas to be short with someone is more or less to be rude to them.It can sometimes work to deliberately phrase statements more weakly than you mean. To put \"perhaps\" in front of something you're actually quite sure of. But you'll notice that when writers do this, they usually do it with a wink.I don't like to do this too much. It's cheesy to adopt an ironic tone for a whole essay. I think we just have to face the fact that elegance and curtness are two names for the same thing.You might think that if you work sufficiently hard to ensure that an essay is correct, it will be invulnerable to attack. That's sort of true. It will be invulnerable to valid attacks. But in practice that's little consolation.In fact, the strength component of useful writing will make you particularly vulnerable to misrepresentation. If you've stated an idea as strongly as you could without making it false, all anyone has to do is to exaggerate slightly what you said, and now it is false.Much of the time they're not even doing it deliberately. One of the most surprising things you'll discover, if you start writing essays, is that people who disagree with you rarely disagree with what you've actually written. Instead they make up something you said and disagree with that.For what it's worth, the countermove is to ask someone who does this to quote a specific sentence or passage you wrote that they believe is false, and explain why. I say \"for what it's worth\" because they never do. So although it might seem that this could get a broken discussion back on track, the truth is that it was never on track in the first place.Should you explicitly forestall likely misinterpretations? Yes, if they're misinterpretations a reasonably smart and well-intentioned person might make. In fact it's sometimes better to say something slightly misleading and then add the correction than to try to get an idea right in one shot. That can be more efficient, and can also model the way such an idea would be discovered.But I don't think you should explicitly forestall intentional misinterpretations in the body of an essay. An essay is a place to meet honest readers. You don't want to spoil your house by putting bars on the windows to protect against dishonest ones. The place to protect against intentional misinterpretations is in end-notes. But don't think you can predict them all. People are as ingenious at misrepresenting you when you say something they don't want to hear as they are at coming up with rationalizations for things they want to do but know they shouldn't. I suspect it's the same skill._____ As with most other things, the way to get better at writing essays is to practice. But how do you start? Now that we've examined the structure of useful writing, we can rephrase that question more precisely. Which constraint do you relax initially? The answer is, the first component of importance: the number of people who care about what you write.If you narrow the topic sufficiently, you can probably find something you're an expert on. Write about that to start with. If you only have ten readers who care, that's fine. You're helping them, and you're writing. Later you can expand the breadth of topics you write about.The other constraint you can relax is a little surprising: publication. Writing essays doesn't have to mean publishing them. That may seem strange now that the trend is to publish every random thought, but it worked for me. I wrote what amounted to essays in notebooks for about 15 years. I never published any of them and never expected to. I wrote them as a way of figuring things out. But when the web came along I'd had a lot of practice.Incidentally,  Steve  Wozniak did the same thing. In high school he designed computers on paper for fun. He couldn't build them because he couldn't afford the components. But when Intel launched 4K DRAMs in 1975, he was ready._____ How many essays are there left to write though? The answer to that question is probably the most exciting thing I've learned about essay writing. Nearly all of them are left to write.Although the essay  is an old form, it hasn't been assiduously cultivated. In the print era, publication was expensive, and there wasn't enough demand for essays to publish that many. You could publish essays if you were already well known for writing something else, like novels. Or you could write book reviews that you took over to express your own ideas. But there was not really a direct path to becoming an essayist. Which meant few essays got written, and those that did tended to be about a narrow range of subjects.Now, thanks to the internet, there's a path. Anyone can publish essays online. You start in obscurity, perhaps, but at least you can start. You don't need anyone's permission.It sometimes happens that an area of knowledge sits quietly for years, till some change makes it explode. Cryptography did this to number theory. The internet is doing it to the essay.The exciting thing is not that there's a lot left to write, but that there's a lot left to discover. There's a certain kind of idea that's best discovered by writing essays. If most essays are still unwritten, most such ideas are still undiscovered.Notes[1] Put railings on the balconies, but don't put bars on the windows.[2] Even now I sometimes write essays that are not meant for publication. I wrote several to figure out what Y Combinator should do, and they were really helpful.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.Spanish TranslationJapanese Translation"
